01_Bahi_Yowao,1,Bahi ,"The story Bahi was told by Yowao in 1991. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-bahi1.mp3. This text is intended to explain the initiation of pubescent girls, which is still celebrated today. It has the following components: When the girl has her first menstruation, she goes into a seclusion hut, which is totally dark inside. She stays there by herself for several months, only going out to bathe with female relatives, and to go to the garden with them. When she goes out, she wears a covering over her head so that no men or boys see her face, and so she doesn’t see them. It is said that if she sees them, they will get sick. At her coming out feast, there are several days of feasting, culminating with bringing the girl out and placing her lying face down on two logs. The men whip her bare back and legs with switches. She is taken away, and she hardly eats anything for several days, while her wounds heal. The women go after the men with faggots, and burn them in the stomach, to pay them back for harming the girl. Since the men are drunk, they can’t get away and they do get burned. The main character of the text is Bahi, which is the same as the word for ‚sun/thunder‘. There is in fact a connection between the character Bahi and the sun: Bahi menstruates, and the red color of blood is said to be connected with the color of the sun at sunrise. There are various connections between the events in the story and aspects of the girls’ initiation. Interestingly, Bahi is a man. He is teaching the women how they will be.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025.

This text is a self-contained series of episodes from a longer story about Bahi. 1 In the beginning and ending sections of the text, which I have not included here, Bahi shows his extraordinary powers, turning people into various kinds of animals, and arriving at a place with a flash of light. In the present episodes, however, Bahi seems like a pretty normal person: he hunts woolly monkeys and tapirs, and gets married.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. Bahi .

The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-firstcorn. mp3. According to this story, the man who first introduced the various crops that the Jarawaras grow in their gardens, especially corn, became the first Paumari when he subsequently went away. The Paumaris are close neighbors of the Jarawaras on the Purus River, and they speak a somewhat distantly related Arawan lan- guage. One of the characters in the story is a grandmother who became the first snake. The origin of body piercing and beating with a switch is connected with the origin of gardening in the story.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. The first corn.

An old man was left alone to take care of his three grandsons, and he was so hungry that he killed the two smaller grandsons and roasted them and ate them. The older grandson ran away to his parents and told them what happened. When they got back, the man’s daughter complained, but her husband didn’t say anything. The man’s son, who had been out hunting, also returned. When he also complained, the man went for his spear, but his son broke it in pieces.

The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/ brazil/files/siko-mankose.mp3. Siko told a number of very funny stories, and this is one of them. The Jarawaras are afraid of monsters that live in the forest, but in Siko's stories, the monsters, who are generally not very bright, just about always lose. The story also gives some insight into shamanism among the Jarawaras. The man who is the main character of the story is a shaman, and with his shamanic powers he manages to foil the attempts of the kose mati monster to drown him. And when he calls out for help, two of his familiar spirits come and rescue him from the monster. They kill the monster, and carry it away and eat it.",Siko,"Siko. 2025.

She waits while he puts poison on the points of his arrows and blowgun darts. She tires of waiting, though, and leaves to go fishing by herself. When she gets back with her catch, her husband has taken and eaten some of the tapioca that she had prepared, and she is upset. In her anger she insults him, and he withdraws to sulk in his hammock, refusing to eat. The next morning he leaves by himself to go after a river turtle. The other men go after him, and they go hunting together. After killing some monkeys, he goes after a turtle. But the turtle is very large, and it carries him from the beach into the water, where he is killed and eaten by caimans. The man’s brother-in-law, who is the older brother of his wife, wants to kill his sister when he gets back to the village, but the others restrain him.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. The caimans killed the man.

08_Siraba,8,Siraba,"The story Siraba was told by Yowao in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-siraba.mp3. Siraba was a teenage girl who went with her cross-cousin to get siro fruits in the forest. There they encountered a spirit who impersonated Siraba’s cousin’s brother, who was supposed to marry Siraba. Siraba saw that it was a spirit, and the two girls managed to run away. But the spirit caught up with them later in the village. This time he succeeded in deceiving Siraba, and he took her away and spent the night with her. When she came home in the morning, she soon died. The last part of the text briefly tells the story of how the Jarawaras were orig- inally part of a larger group that came from upstream. The group were ferry- ing themselves across the Purus River, when the man who was ferrying them got tired and quit, leaving the group divided on the two sides of the river. The group that had been ferried decided to go on, and they became the present-day Jarawaras. The group that remained on the other side went back to where they came from. Yowao’s son Okomobi asks his father questions at several points, this is shown in the English translation.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025. Siraba.

In this story, about a group of girls, one girl escapes, but her friends are killed, because they failed to listen to her warning.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. The jaguars ate the girls.

The corresponding au- dio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko- totoabono.mp3. The spirit of the toto bamboo didn't know how to fish or hunt, so he married his aunt’s daughter in order to kill her and eat her. When he got hungry again, he went to his aunt and asked for another daughter, and he did the same thing again with her. Finally he brought the other two sisters to his village, but they caught on when they found the skulls of their sisters, and they ran home. Then, since the toto spirit didn’t have any meat, he cut out his own belly and roasted it and ate it. This resulted in his death, of course. His brother-in-law lambasted him for marrying his sisters to eat them instead of having children with them.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. The toto spirit.

12_Maiko,12,Maiko,"The story Maiko was told by Yowao in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-maiko2.mp3. Maiko was a powerful shaman, who was able to kill maka monsters. The maka monster was occuppying Maiko’s fishing place, so Maiko turned himself into a kingfisher and stabbed the monster. Maiko caught some fish, and came home. Maiko’s two nephews went out fishing, and they offered a large amount of cooked fish to Maiko. They thought they could embarrass him by offering him more than he could eat, but he ate it all. Then he got them back by cooking two batches of taro for them to eat, and they couldn’t eat it all. Maiko went fishing again, this time with his wife. As he was fishing, she went into the forest to defecate, and there she saw a dead deer. She told him about it, and after investigating, he concluded it had been killed by a maka monster. They decided to take the deer home to eat, but the monster held onto the deer, trying to keep Maiko from taking it. But they made it home with the deer, along with the fish that Maiko had caught. Maiko cooked part of the deer and roasted another part, but they only ate the fish. The monster came to the village after the deer, along with its mate. Maiko gave the deer meat to them. When they refused to leave, Maiko called his familiar spirits to help him. But they were overpowered by the monster. So he took a brand from the fire, and put a spell on it, and threw it at the monsters. This killed the female monster, and her mate took her and went away.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025. Maiko.

13_The_Yimas,13,The Yimas,"The story The Yimas was told by Yowao in 1993. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao- theyimas.mp3. In the stories of the Jarawaras, their most traditional enemies were the Yi- mas. Tradition says that they were close neighbors of the Jarawaras. Today the Jarawaras identify the Yimas with the Jumas, a Tupi-Guarani speaking group that formerly inhabited an area between L’brea and Humait’. The identification seems dubious to me, since the Jumas never crossed the Purus. Also, in the sto- ries, the Jarawaras and Yimas converse with each other, indicating they probably spoke closely related languages. In this text, two encounters with the Yimas are narrated. The first involves Saba and his companions, who attacked a Yima village. In the second episode, a man leaves his parents alone in their village when the rest of the people go to another village for a feast. The couple are supposed to come to the feast later, but they are captured by Yimas and taken to the Yima village. Their son discovers what has happened, and he and his companions go to the Yima village to rescue their relatives. They succeed, and kill many Yimas in the attack.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025. The Yimas.

A Jarawara man named Mayawari set out with his young son to spend the night waiting for monkeys to come to eat fruits of a ko tree. A group of enemy Yimas ambushed them on the way, and killed them with spears. They draped the boy’s intestines on sticks stuck in the ground, so the other Jarawaras would see them. When Mayawari and his son didn’t come back, his son-in-law went out after him. When he cried out in the forest and a Yima answered him, he came running home. After that, two men went out after the Yimas, but they were gone.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. Mayawari. In Alan Vogel (ed.), The Stories of Siko and Yowao: Jarawara texts  (Open Text Collections 3).

The events of this story happened during the lifetime of Yowao's (and Siko’s) grandfather, probably before Yowao’s father was born. A man named Kamabira became sick after he ate meat of a woolly monkey that still had blood in it, and he started acting strangely. After a short time he died. His companions concluded that he had been attacked by a maka monster, which had taken the form of a woolly monkey. Siko also told a version of this story. The details are similar, except that in his version, Kamabira was attacked when he killed some howler monkeys with his blowgun. The Jarawaras don’t consider howlers very good for food. It was concluded that the howlers were maka monsters in disguise.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025. Kamabira. In Alan Vogel (ed.), The Stories of Siko and Yowao: Jarawara texts  (Open Text Collections 3).

The corresponding au- dio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko- poisonroot.mp3. This story references the time when Siko’s father was a young boy. It is about a man named Aifa, who composed songs that were sung at the feast they would have when they poisoned fish in the streams. This is still one of the ways the Jarawaras fish today, but without the singing and dancing. In the dry season when the water level is low, they put mashed roots of the kona plant in the stream, to slow down the fish and make it easier to spear them. The kona is a cultivated plant, and the Jarawaras find it in the secondary forest at the locations of old abandoned villages.",Siko,"Siko. 2025. The poison root song.

The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko- cougar.mp3. Siko's father, Botehefo, was attacked one day in the forest by a cougar. When this happened Botehefo was an adult, but the non-eyewitness tense that Siko uses indicates that this occurred before Siko was born. A cougar can kill a man, to be sure, but cougars are not as dangerous as jaguars. Siko’s father struggled with the cougar and managed to make it run away. An indication of the stage of the contact of the Jarawaras with Brazilians is the fact that Siko’s father had a rifle with him. Nowadays shotguns have replaced rifles.",Siko,"Siko. 2025.

Yowao’s father encountered the pair in the forest, and he killed the female first, and then the male, with his rifle. Yowao indicates that he was alive when this happened. He and his friends wanted to go look at the monsters, but the others would not let them. The second story is shorter, and it is about a spirit that Yowao’s father encoun- tered, which was crying, apparently because it was cold. Other spirits came and killed it and carried it off to eat it, while Yowao’s father watched. The other spir- its undoubtedly were Yowao’s father’s familiar spirits, who had come to deliver him from the crying spirit.",Yowao,"Yowao. 2025. A pair of monsters.

White-lipped peccaries move through the forest in large bands, and they are dangerous. Yowao found the band of peccaries, and killed several.
