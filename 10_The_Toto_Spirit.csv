He called his father's sister. ""Aunt, I want to be with your daughter.""","The words hinakaso biti are a false start. | When I first published this story (Vogel 2012), I assumed that Toto Abono was a human being. But toto abono also means 'spirit of toto bamboo'. After reading the Portuguese translation of the Jamamadi version of the story in Shiratori (2018:163f), in which hado abono is 'spirit of hado bamboo', and only appears as a human being, I wondered whether this might be true for the Jarawara version as well. I asked Bibiri, and he wasn't sure, but he said toto abono does seem to be a spirit. I have made the change here, but some doubt remains: if he was hiding his true identity from people, it seems strange to me that he would be known as Toto Abono, and addressed as such, as in for example sentence (31). | The NP toto abono consists of the inalienably possessed noun abono, which has no marking for gender, and the possessor toto, which is a feminine noun. The NP, however, is masculine, as seen in the agreement throughout the text. The reason for this is that all spirits are assumed to be males, unless they are specified with the addition of the noun fana as being females, as is the case, for example with tokowisa abono fana in ""Maiko"".",WORD_ALIGNED
